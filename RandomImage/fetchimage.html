<!-- 
This shows different methods of calling a nodejs server from a web page.
Once the server starts up, it listens for requests from browsers.
The basic request returns the HTML for a web page (fetch2.html).
That's the page you see when you go to that URL.

Using app.get() and app.post() you can set up "routes".
These are strings in the URL following the URL (https://localhost:8080/)
and recognized by the server. For example, `app.get('/textresponse')` responds to
(https://localhost:8080/textresponse)

The difference between GET and POST is that GET has argument valuesin the URL and
POST has argument values passed as a "body" attribute in the HTTP call.

The server code example here has a mix of GETs and POSTs, some returning text,
some returning a file, and some returning JSON.
